# Packages Used -

# Folder structure - 
- Controllers -
	- All our controller are contained here
	- ProductsController.cs
	- All the controllers will first check if the user id is an admin or not (right I have used a fairly simple way to judge that - which can be improved upon later given the proper scenario)
	- If yes then only they will proceed
		- GetAllItems
			- Gets the list of all items
		- GetProductById
			- Gets the product for given id
		- UpdateItem
			- Updates the item respectively
		- DeleteItem
			- Deletes the item respectively
		- AddNewItem
			- Adds a new item respectilvely
		
		- Kindly check the code - specially the BLL folder to check for all the validations for these respective apis/functions
